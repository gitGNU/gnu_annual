Description: Keeps track of pending events and reminds you hopefully in right time
 Provided by a list of events stored in different files, this program sorts these events out,
 which will not come up in the next days. The result can be displayed in command-line or
 via Qt. Moreover, a manager supports the graphical edition of the events.
 .
 Note that the script `2annual` needs perl.
